# still misdiagnosed as a timing/discovery-cache race. The actual cause
# was `v1beta1` vs `v1`: this CRD serves both, but only `v1` (the storage
# version) ever worked — `v1beta1` failed 100% of the time, every
# attempt, regardless of waits, retries, or separate apply processes.
# Once that's fixed, there's no known reason kubectl_manifest wouldn't
# work here the same way it already does for root_app.
